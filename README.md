# hello-world
My name is Tito and I am 25 years old. Currently I have just achieved a bachelor degree; majoring in International Economics. 
I want to learn code. The problem is I dont have any knowledges related to Computer Sciene. Yet, I'll try my best to learn coding. I am now in the process of introduction to Python.
